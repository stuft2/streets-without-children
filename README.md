# When a County Has More Kids, Transportation Barriers Rise

**Date:** 2026-02-23

In counties where families make up a larger share of the population, transportation challenges are more common.

## What the Numbers Mean in Real Terms

Across 2,417 counties, we find:

- If the share of children increases by **10 percentage points** (for example, from 20% of the population to 30%),
- The share of adults reporting transportation barriers increases by about **1.8 percentage points**.

That may sound small. But across a county of 100,000 adults, that translates to roughly **1,800 additional adults** facing transportation challenges.

The pattern is statistically precise: the true increase is very likely between about **1.5 and 2.1 percentage points**.

## Where the Pattern Is Strongest

The relationship is not uniform across the country.

It is strongest in:

- **Northeast**
- **West**

More moderate in:

- **South**

Weakest in:

- **Midwest**

In other words, in some regions, counties with more children see transportation barriers rise sharply; in others, the increase is present but more modest.

## Why This Matters

Children do not drive. They depend on adults, shared trips, and infrastructure that supports families.

When a county has a higher concentration of children, the transportation system may be under greater strain, especially for households juggling work, school, and caregiving.

The data suggest that family demographics and adult mobility challenges are connected.

## What This Does *Not* Show

-   This does not prove that having more children causes transportation barriers.
-   The analysis is based on county-level averages and individual experiences vary.
-   Other local factors, including land use, transit access, income levels, also shape outcomes.

# When a County Has More Kids, Transportation Barriers Rise

**Date:** 2026-02-23

## The Big Idea

Counties with more children tend to have more adults who struggle with
transportation.

Put plainly: as the share of kids goes up, transportation challenges for
adults rise in step.

## What the Numbers Mean in Real Terms

Across 2,417 counties, we find:

-   If the share of children increases by **10 percentage points** (for
    example, from 20% of the population to 30%),\
-   The share of adults reporting transportation barriers increases by
    about **1.8 percentage points**.

That may sound small. But across a county of 100,000 adults, that
translates to roughly **1,800 additional adults** facing transportation
challenges.

The pattern is statistically precise: the true increase is very likely
between about **1.5 and 2.1 percentage points**.

## Where the Pattern Is Strongest

The relationship is not uniform across the country.

It is strongest in:

-   **Northeast**
-   **West**

More moderate in:

-   **South**

Weakest in:

-   **Midwest**

In other words, in some regions, counties with more children see
transportation barriers rise sharply; in others, the increase is present
but more modest.

## Why This Matters

Children do not drive. They depend on adults, shared trips, and
infrastructure that supports families.

When a county has a higher concentration of children, the transportation
system may be under greater strain --- especially for households
juggling work, school, and caregiving.

The data suggest that family demographics and adult mobility challenges
are connected.

## What This Does *Not* Show

-   This does not prove that having more children causes transportation
    barriers.\
-   The analysis is based on county-level averages; individual
    experiences vary.\
-   Other local factors --- land use, transit access, income levels ---
    also shape outcomes.

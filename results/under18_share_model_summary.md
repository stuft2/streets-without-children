# Summary: Under-18 Share and Transportation Barriers

**Date:** 2026-02-23

## Objective
Assess whether counties with a higher share of children also report higher adult transportation barriers.

## Key Finding (All Counties, Adjusted Model)
- Estimated association: **17.99**.
- Interpretation: a 10-point increase in child share is associated with about **1.8 percentage points** higher transportation barriers.
- 95% confidence interval: **14.9 to 21.09**.
- Counties included: **2417**.
- Model R-squared: **0.064**.

## Regional Results (Adjusted Models)
Larger values indicate a stronger positive association.
- **Northeast**: 32.67 (range 17.44 to 47.91)
- **West**: 28.46 (range 22.23 to 34.69)
- **South**: 17.55 (range 13.07 to 22.04)
- **Midwest**: 8.79 (range 5.21 to 12.38)

## Interpretation
The data show a consistent positive association: counties with more children tend to report higher transportation barriers among adults.

## Limits
- This is an association, not proof of cause and effect.
- The model uses county-level data, so local context can still vary.
- Other factors beyond population size may also influence barriers.
